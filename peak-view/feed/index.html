Thank you Janice for a lovely response.  It&#039;s so good to hear the story from people on the other side. Re-discovering creativity is definitely something to look forward to. And I so agree about it being a privilege to get older.  &quot;Each further step is a gift.&quot; I might quote you on that.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear Jo - thank you so much for your thoughts and generous gift - I understand the stage of life you are passing through as I am well on the other side ! And once you are well on the other side it is a feeling of liberation and renewal and a different perspective . That is not to say I sometimes don&#039;t feel a little invisible or surplus to the requirements of this fast moving techno world but I have a new-found confidence which allows me to be less self conscious and more able to speak my mind drawing on my life&#039;s experience . Now my beautiful child is grown - I am re-discovering my own creativity . It is a privilege to have reached this age - some don&#039;t reach so far - each further step is a gift . Continue on your way .... Happy birthday !
