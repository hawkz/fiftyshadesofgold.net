What a lovely comment, Sarah. I&#039;m glad you liked the pen-pen-penultimate poem, because I received that one from you originally. And I&#039;m pleased you appreciated &quot;the ragged and jagged&quot; too.  That piece by Clarissa almost didn&#039;t make the final cut on the grounds that I&#039;d used so much by Clarissa already and it did the same job as Rumi&#039;s Guest House. But in the end I couldn&#039;t delete it because I liked  &quot;the ragged and the jagged&quot; so much. What a wonderful description! I think on it so many times as I meander through life.  &quot;Ah! That&#039;ll be the ragged and jagged. Hello!&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Advent Sunday, and finally the ring-fenced space for the full fifty (plus) steps of the fiftyshadesofgold.net  meditation that&#039;s been waiting since your birthday for its time, like a treasure in the wings.  (More accurately, it&#039;s &quot;stolen&quot; space, between teenage chauffeuring duties - and the To Do List will have to wait!) What a dancing conversation between you and others who have travelled the journey: how inspirational, highlighting the dance within the muddle and juggle and fraying edges and letting go of it all.  I love the non-ending, with a-blooming-nother thought - so your pen-pen-penultimate stage provoked a smile-that&#039;s-burst-in-to-a-laugh!  It confirms so graphically that the conversation continues.  Thank God!   I&#039;ll be coming back to draw on the deep resource of this treasure trove fifthieth year conversation.  And I&#039;ll be continuing the conversation with you going forwards, embracing the ragged and jagged, lilting and soaring, as we continue to step forward, daring to believe that all can be used as life&#039;s energy.  Thanks, Jo!]]></description>
