Yes, Chris, I am indeed, very thankful.  Those men, large and small, make gratitude very easy. x]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[HI Jo thankyou for thinking of me and sending me a copy of Fiftyshades of Gold.I think that most women of a certain age can relate to certain passages that you quoted, but what we have to remember is that we have had our youthful days and now its time to accept our mature years and be thankful that we can.Happy birthday when it comes and i am sure the two men in your life will make it a special one.]]></description>

That&#039;s a great deal, Bean. If you look after my cat, I&#039;ll stir the cauldron  for you. Hope you like the pictures of Harry the Campervan and the quote from Winnie the Pooh.]]></description>

Wow! What awesome words Debbie!  Thank you. (And the feeling is mutual, by the way.) I&#039;m glad you appreciated the envelope.  I found myself very fussy about the stationery - the colour, the weight, the size. It was all part of the fun. x]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Jo-
When I saw the beautiful cream-coloured envelope, I was very appreciative. I thought &quot;only nice things can come in such lovely stationary&quot;. Little did I know, the envelope contained the most uplifting and soul nourishing little book. I devoured it on the train to London yesterday and I feel so privileged to be included in your journey. You are such a blessing in my life. Over the years I have always admired your vitality, courage and forthrightness (is that a word?) as well as your beautiful, luminous skin (What do you use? Asses&#039; milk?). Jo, you are my friend, mentor, heroine and sister.  I look up to you in so many ways- you have no idea! I send you my love and congratulations in this, your fiftieth year and always. Thanks sis.

Love Debbie]]></description>
